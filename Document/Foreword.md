If this was a normal security book, the introduction would start with a list of impressive facts and data proving importance of mobile devices in this day and age. The author would then go on to explain how mobile application security is broken, and why a book like this was sorely needed. And, thank you so much to the wife and friends for all the support, the book wouldn't have been possible without it.

But the MSTG is not a normal security book. Nor does it have a single author. It is an open, crowd-sourced effort, made of the contributions of dozens of authors and reviewers from all over the world. Our wholehearted thanks go to everyone who contributed to this project. Special commendations also go to the OWASP Foundation, for being the hub bringing all of us together, as well as funding the project.

We do have a message to our readers however. The first rule of the OWASP Mobile Security Testing Guide is: Don't just follow the OWASP Mobile Security Testing Guide. True excellence at mobile application security requires a deep understanding of mobile operating system, coding, network security, cryptography, and a whole lot of other things, many of which we can only touch on briefly in this book. Don't stop at security testing. Write your own apps, compile your own kernels, dissect mobile malware, learn how things tick. And as you keep learning new things, consider contributing to the MSTG yourself! "Do a pull request", as they say.
