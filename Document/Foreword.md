Mobile app security is a thing. As of this writing however, there is no widely accepted list of security best practices for mobile apps. Thus, on a beautiful summer day, a group of ~7 young men, a woman, and approximately three squirrels met in a Woburn Forest villa. So far, nothing unusual. But little did you know, within the next five days, they'd redefine not only mobile application security, but the very fundamentals of bookwriting itself!

Or maybe not. But at the very least, the Mobile Security Testing Guide (MSTG) is an unusual security book. It doesn't have a single author. Instead, it is an open, agile, crowd-sourced effort, made of the contributions of dozens of authors and reviewers from all over the world. 

With the MSTG, we aim to create those best practices, along with a comprehensive set of security test cases to verify them. The best practices and test cases are packaged into beginner friendly, complete and practical guide to mobile app security testing and reverse engineering.

This is an early preview edition of the MSTG that contains an acceptable, but far from perfect, version of the Android portions of the guide. We made it because we wanted our OWASP Summit working session to have a tangible result (and because OWASP asked us to do it). The final version of the guide, which will cover a wide range of Android, iOS, and OS-independent topics, is scheduled for release in the first quarter of 2018.

Our wholehearted thanks go to everyone who contributed to this project. We'd also like to thank the OWASP Foundation for bringing all of us together, and organizing and sponsoring this fantastic event.
